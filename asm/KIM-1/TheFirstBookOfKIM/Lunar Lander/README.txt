Description -
     This program starts at 0200.  When started, you will find
yourself at 4500 feet and falling.  The thrust on your machine
is set to low; so you will pick up speed due to the force of
gravity.
    You can look at your fuel at any time by pressing the
"F" button.  Your fuel (initially 800 pounds) will be shown
in the first four digits of the KIM display.
    The first two digits of the KIM display always show
your rate of descent or ascent.  "A" restores altitude.
    Set your thrust by pressing buttons 1 through 9.
Warning: button 0 turns you motor off, and it will not
reignite!  A thrust of 1, minimum, burns very little fuel;
but gravity will be pulling your craft down faster and
faster.  A thrust of 9, maximum, overcomes gravity
and reduces your rate of descent very sharply  A thrust of 5
exactly counterbalances gravity; you will continue to descend
(or ascend) at a constant rate.  If you run out of fuel,
your thrust controls will become inoperative.
    A safe landing is considered to be one where you land
at a descent rate of 5 or less. After you land, your thrust
controls will be inoperative, since the motor is automatically
turned off; but you can still press "F" to look at your fuel.
Pressing "GO" starts a new flight.

Suggestions for a safe flight:
  (1) Conserve fuel at the beginning by pressing 1.  You
      begin to pick up speed downwards.
  (2) When your rate of descent gets up to the 90's, you're
      falling fast enough.  Press 5 to steady the rate.
  (3) When your altitude reaches about 1500 feet, you'll
      need to slow down.  Press 9 and slow down fast.
  (4) When your rate of descent has dropped to 15 or 20,
      steady the craft by pressing 5 or 6. Now you're on
      your own.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:  Ted Beach suggested the addition of 
the F flag when displaying fuel. Chuck Eaton spotted 
the cause of an erratic bug in the original keyboard 
input subroutine.  Thanks to both.

Corrections:

LUNAR LANDER. page 84:  After viewing fuel, return to altitude display
         by pressing button A.
