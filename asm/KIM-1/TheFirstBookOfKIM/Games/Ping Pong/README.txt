Play against the computer, or            C  slam  F
change the program for a two-player
game.  On each shot, you choose          8  block B
between four plays:  Spin, Lob,
Block, or Slam.  If you're playing       4   lob  7
the left side of the court, use the
left-hand buttons (0, 4, 8 and C).       0  spin  3
See the diagram at right.

Each shot has its own strengths and weaknesses:  for
example, a Slam is a powerful shot, but it's also likely
to be "fluffed".  Strategy is not trivial - your chances
of success on any play depend not only on your choice of
shot, but on what shots have gone before.  You'll have to
learn the combinations the hard way.

You'll see the net in the middle of the court.  Don't try
to play the ball until it is on your side of the net, or
you'll lose the point.  Each type of shot has a
distinctive appearance, which you'll learn to recognize.
They are similar to the key positions:  a Spin lights the
bottom segment, a Lob lights the middle segment, a Block
lights the upper segment, and the mighty Slam shot lights
all three segments and travels faster.

The original version of the game was published for the
HP-67 calculator in "65 Notes", V4N2P5.  Authorship was
not given.

At first, the shots will come too fast for you to cope
with.  There are two ways to solve this.  The easy way is
the "freeze" the ball by holding down any unused key,
like AD or 7:  play will be suspended until you figure
out what you want to do next.  The harder way, but not
too hard, is just to slow down the ball by changing the
program:  locations 0331 to 0334 contain the speeds for
each type of shot.  Increase these values and the ball
will slow down, e.g., 40 40 40 28 will halve the speed.

For a two-player game, where KIM does not play the right
side, change location 032C to 01.  To have KIM play the
left side, change location 032B to 00.
KIM plays a strong game, but CAN BE BEATEN!
