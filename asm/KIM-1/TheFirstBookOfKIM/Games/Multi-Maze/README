MULTI-MAZE
BY JIM BUTTERFIELD

Description:  Find your way out of the maze.  You are the
flashing light in the centre of the display.  As you move
up (key 9), down (1), left (4) or right (6), KIM will keep
you in the central display;  you'll see the walls of the maze
moving by as you travel.  Like walking through a real maze,
you'll only see a small part of the maze as you pass through.
If you can get out, you'll find yourself in a large open
area; that means you've won.  Press GO at any time for
a new maze.  Program starts at address 0200.
