This directory contains source code for the PLEASE software package
for the KIM-1 written by Robert M. Tripp in 1977.

It was originally distributed on cassette tape.

I am entering the original source code in a format that it can be
cross-assembled and loaded as a paper tape (PTP) file.

See the PDF documentation for details.
