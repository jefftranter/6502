This is a port of Enhanced BASIC 2.22 for the Replica 1. A copy of the
original source is in the file source.zip. The original code came from
http://mycorner.no-ip.org/6502/ehbasic/index.html

To build it on a Linux system, use the provided make file, i.e. "make"
It builds with the cc65 assembler.

A prebuilt Woz monitor binary file is provided. The start address is
the same as the load address, $5000.

If you want to run it on a system that doesn't support displaying
lowercase characters, such as an Apple 1, Mimeo or Obtronix, there is
a patch that will convert all the displayed strings to uppercase.
Apply the patch UPPERCASE.patch. I've provided a binary with this
patch applied in the file basic-uppercase.mon.

SAVE and LOAD commands will call the menu for a CFFA1 flash card, if
one is present.

Known issues:

IRQ and NMI handling is not implemented because the vectors are in the
Woz monitor ROM and cannot be changed.

Also included is a port to the Ohio Scientific Superboard
II/Challenger 1P and compatibles like the Briel Computers Superboard
///. To build this version use the make file Makefile.osi.

Another port is to my 6502 Single Board Computer design. To build this
version use the make file Makefile.sbc.

SAVE enables output to the serial/cassette port (just like for the OSI
BASIC in ROM). To turn off SAVE, do "POKE 517,0".

LOAD enables output from the serial/cassette port (just like for the
OSI BASIC in ROM). To turn off LOAD, do "POKE 515,0".

Known issues:

The BASIC Control-C check interferes with keyboard input. The
workaround is to do POKE 768,1 to turn it off.
